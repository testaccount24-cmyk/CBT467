+
     Many times, users find a need to use the option 6 TSO screen for
     a quick command.

     By entering the TSOCMD command, the option 6 screen will be displayed,
     the user can execute his TSO commands, he can then hit his end key and
     return normal processing.  The TSOCMD screen can be exited by entering
     cancel or hitting your END key.

     The TSOCMD has no aliases or abbreviations.

     The TSOCMD may also be entered similar to the TSO command. By entering
     TSOCMD followed by a TSO command (e.g. TSOCMD ST), the option 6 screen
     will be prefilled with the command and enter will be hit for the user.
