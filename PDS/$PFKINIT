                      |    THE 'PFKINIT' COMMAND     |
                      --------------------------------
+
     When creating an ISPF function, some vendors decide to set their
     function up to run with a new set of Pfkeys. One example is JESMASTER.
+
     To set Jesmaster's Pfkeys to look identical to your regular Pfkeys for
     the rest of ISPF, use this command while under JESMASTER. It will have
     no affect under the rest of ISPF.

%SYNTAX:
