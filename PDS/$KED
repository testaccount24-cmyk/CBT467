                      ------------------------------
+
     Currently, ISPF/PDF has no feature that allows a user to EDIT a
     dataset if the user knows only the DDname allocated to it. This
     command allows a user to edit a dataset by specifying the DDname.
     For Example:  KED SYSIN (invokes edit on the file allocated to SYSIN)

     Optionally, a profile  or edit macro may be specified:
     For Example:  KED SYSIN PROFILE(CLIST)

     If the DDname points to a PDS, you may request a member by enclosing
     it in parentheses.
     For Example:  KED JCLPDS(DUMPER)  or KED JCLPDS(DUMPER) PROFILE(CNTL)
